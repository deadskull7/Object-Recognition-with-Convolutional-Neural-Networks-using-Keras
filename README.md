#### CIFAR-10 dataset with 60,000 images is used to compare the two different CNN models with different number of layers, different parameters and hyperparameters like epochs , batch size ,etc... and finally the different validation accuracies and loss is obtained .One model is more complex than the other and produces better results than the former .
